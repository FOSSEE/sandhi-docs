## Scope

### Current Development
* Include block for Multiple Input Multiple Output(MIMO) system.
* Include Kalman Filter Block.

### Areas to be explore
* Making it easier and more intuitive to implement loops and conditional loops; Ref: [GNU Radio loops in top_block](http://sumitgnuradio.blogspot.in/2012/10/either-you-can-use-tb.html)
* Deploying Sandhi as a web-service
* Using GPU cores through OpenGL to increase operation speed
